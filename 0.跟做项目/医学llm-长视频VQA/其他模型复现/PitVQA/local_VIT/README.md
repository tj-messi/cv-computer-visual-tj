# Vision Transformer (base-sized model) 

Vision Transformer (ViT) model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k (14 million images, 21,843 classes) at resolution 224x224. It was introduced in the paper [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) by Dosovitskiy et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer). However, the weights were converted from the [timm repository](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models) by Ross Wightman, who already converted the weights from JAX to PyTorch. Credits go to him. 

Disclaimer: The team releasing ViT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.

## Model description

The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like) pretrained on a large collection of images in a supervised fashion, namely ImageNet-21k, at a resolution of 224x224 pixels. 

Images are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds absolute position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.

Note that this model does not provide any fine-tuned heads, as these were zero'd by Google researchers. However, the model does include the pre-trained pooler, which can be used for downstream tasks (such as image classification).

By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of images that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled images for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire image.

## Intended uses & limitations

You can use the raw model for image classification. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=google/vit) to look for
fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.

### How to use

Here is how to use this model in PyTorch:

```python
from transformers import ViTImageProcessor, ViTModel
from PIL import Image
import requests

url = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

processor = ViTImageProcessor.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k')
model = ViTModel.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k')
inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

outputs = model(**inputs)
last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state
```

Here is how to use this model in JAX/Flax:

```python
from transformers import ViTImageProcessor, FlaxViTModel
from PIL import Image
import requests

url = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

processor = ViTImageProcessor.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k')
model = FlaxViTModel.from_pretrained('google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k')

inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="np")
outputs = model(**inputs)
last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state
```

## Training data

The ViT model was pretrained on [ImageNet-21k](http://www.image-net.org/), a dataset consisting of 14 million images and 21k classes. 

## Training procedure

### Preprocessing

The exact details of preprocessing of images during training/validation can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer/blob/master/vit_jax/input_pipeline.py). 

Images are resized/rescaled to the same resolution (224x224) and normalized across the RGB channels with mean (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and standard deviation (0.5, 0.5, 0.5).

### Pretraining

The model was trained on TPUv3 hardware (8 cores). All model variants are trained with a batch size of 4096 and learning rate warmup of 10k steps. For ImageNet, the authors found it beneficial to additionally apply gradient clipping at global norm 1. Pre-training resolution is 224.

## Evaluation results

For evaluation results on several image classification benchmarks, we refer to tables 2 and 5 of the original paper. Note that for fine-tuning, the best results are obtained with a higher resolution (384x384). Of course, increasing the model size will result in better performance.
