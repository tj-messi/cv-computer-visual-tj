### **_DISCLAIMER_**: 
_<U>The labels provided on this repository are unofficial and have not been verified. Labels were unofficially created by non-experts (annotated without any domain knowledge of the dataset or access to out-of-band data that could confirm the labels) and may contain mislabeled points (both false negatives, and false posatives). 
We referred to other time-series anomaly detection papers using the datasets   ([Malhotra et al., 2015.](https://www.elen.ucl.ac.be/Proceedings/esann/esannpdf/es2015-56.pdf),
[Malhotra et al., 2016.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00148.pdf)) 
and the author's dataset presentation slides to label anomaly points in this time series as accurately as possible. If you need accurate label information, you should refer to the official [dataset](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/discords/) [description](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/discords/ICDM05_discords.pdf) or contact the authors.</U>_

## RNN-based Multi-Step Prediction Model
__0. Architecture__

![arch](./fig/arch.png)

When the value of x_i is known from i=0 to i=t, the model recursively predicts the value of x_i from i=t+1 to i=T. In this figure, t=3, T=8. We first train this model with a trainset which contains no anomalies, then we use the trained model to detect anomalies in a testset, where anomalies are included. 

__1. How to train this model__

Recursive multi-step prediction using RNNs is a rather difficult problem. As the prediction progresses, the prediction errors are accumulated and the predictions rapidly become inaccurate. To solve this problem, we need a model that is robust to input noise.

## Example of usage
__0. Download the dataset:__
Download the five kinds of multivariate time-series dataset
(ecg, gesture,power_demand, respiration, space_shuttle),
and Label all the abnormality points in the dataset.
```
    python 0_download_dataset.py
```


__1. Time-series prediction:__
Train and save RNN based time-series prediction model on a single time-series trainset
```
    python 1_train_predictor.py --data ecg --filename chfdb_chf14_45590.pkl
    python 1_train_predictor.py --data nyc_taxi --filename nyc_taxi.pkl
```
Train multiple models using bash script

```
    ./1_train_predictor_all.sh
```

__2. Anomaly detection:__
Fit multivariate gaussian distribution and
calculate anomaly scores on a single time-series testset
```
    python 2_anomaly_detection.py --data ecg --filename chfdb_chf14_45590.pkl --prediction_window 10
    python 2_anomaly_detection.py --data nyc_taxi --filename nyc_taxi.pkl --prediction_window 10
```

```
    ./2_anomaly_detection_all.sh
```

## Evaluation

Model performance was evaluated by comparing the model output with the pre-labeled ground-truth. Note that the labels are only used for model evaluation. The anomaly score threshold was increased from 0 to some maximum value to plot the change of precision, recall, and f1 score. Here we show only the results for the ECG dataset. Execute the code yourself and see more results.
