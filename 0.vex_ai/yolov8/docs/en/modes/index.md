This comprehensive guide aims to give you an overview and practical insights into each mode, helping you harness the full potential of YOLO11.

## [Train](train.md)

Train mode is used for training a YOLO11 model on a custom dataset. In this mode, the model is trained using the specified dataset and hyperparameters. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters so that it can accurately predict the classes and locations of objects in an image.

[Train Examples](train.md){ .md-button }

## [Val](val.md)

Val mode is used for validating a YOLO11 model after it has been trained. In this mode, the model is evaluated on a validation set to measure its accuracy and generalization performance. This mode can be used to tune the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance.

[Val Examples](val.md){ .md-button }

## [Predict](predict.md)

Predict mode is used for making predictions using a trained YOLO11 model on new images or videos. In this mode, the model is loaded from a checkpoint file, and the user can provide images or videos to perform inference. The model predicts the classes and locations of objects in the input images or videos.

[Predict Examples](predict.md){ .md-button }

## [Export](export.md)

Export mode is used for exporting a YOLO11 model to a format that can be used for deployment. In this mode, the model is converted to a format that can be used by other software applications or hardware devices. This mode is useful when deploying the model to production environments.

[Export Examples](export.md){ .md-button }

## [Track](track.md)

Track mode is used for tracking objects in real-time using a YOLO11 model. In this mode, the model is loaded from a checkpoint file, and the user can provide a live video stream to perform real-time object tracking. This mode is useful for applications such as surveillance systems or self-driving cars.

[Track Examples](track.md){ .md-button }

## [Benchmark](benchmark.md)

Benchmark mode is used to profile the speed and accuracy of various export formats for YOLO11. The benchmarks provide information on the size of the exported format, its `mAP50-95` metrics (for object detection, segmentation, and pose) or `accuracy_top5` metrics (for classification), and the inference time in milliseconds per image across various formats like ONNX, OpenVINO, TensorRT, and others. This information can help users choose the optimal export format for their specific use case based on their requirements for speed and accuracy.

## FAQ

### How do I train a custom [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection) model with Ultralytics YOLO11?

Training a custom object detection model with Ultralytics YOLO11 involves using the train mode. You need a dataset formatted in YOLO format, containing images and corresponding annotation files. Use the following command to start the training process:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pre-trained YOLO model (you can choose n, s, m, l, or x versions)
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Start training on your custom dataset
        model.train(data="path/to/dataset.yaml", epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Train a YOLO model from the command line
        yolo train data=path/to/dataset.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640
        ```

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [Ultralytics Train Guide](../modes/train.md).

### What metrics does Ultralytics YOLO11 use to validate the model's performance?

Ultralytics YOLO11 uses various metrics during the validation process to assess model performance. These include:

- **mAP (mean Average Precision)**: This evaluates the accuracy of object detection.
- **IOU (Intersection over Union)**: Measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.
- **[Precision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/precision) and [Recall](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/recall)**: Precision measures the ratio of true positive detections to the total detected positives, while recall measures the ratio of true positive detections to the total actual positives.

You can run the following command to start the validation:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pre-trained or custom YOLO model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Run validation on your dataset
        model.val(data="path/to/validation.yaml")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Validate a YOLO model from the command line
        yolo val data=path/to/validation.yaml
        ```

Refer to the [Validation Guide](../modes/val.md) for further details.

### How can I export my YOLO11 model for deployment?

Ultralytics YOLO11 offers export functionality to convert your trained model into various deployment formats such as ONNX, TensorRT, CoreML, and more. Use the following example to export your model:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load your trained YOLO model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Export the model to ONNX format (you can specify other formats as needed)
        model.export(format="onnx")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Export a YOLO model to ONNX format from the command line
        yolo export model=yolo11n.pt format=onnx
        ```

Detailed steps for each export format can be found in the [Export Guide](../modes/export.md).

### What is the purpose of the benchmark mode in Ultralytics YOLO11?

Benchmark mode in Ultralytics YOLO11 is used to analyze the speed and [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy) of various export formats such as ONNX, TensorRT, and OpenVINO. It provides metrics like model size, `mAP50-95` for object detection, and inference time across different hardware setups, helping you choose the most suitable format for your deployment needs.

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics.utils.benchmarks import benchmark

        # Run benchmark on GPU (device 0)
        # You can adjust parameters like model, dataset, image size, and precision as needed
        benchmark(model="yolo11n.pt", data="coco8.yaml", imgsz=640, half=False, device=0)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Benchmark a YOLO model from the command line
        # Adjust parameters as needed for your specific use case
        yolo benchmark model=yolo11n.pt data='coco8.yaml' imgsz=640 half=False device=0
        ```

### How can I perform real-time object tracking using Ultralytics YOLO11?

Real-time object tracking can be achieved using the track mode in Ultralytics YOLO11. This mode extends object detection capabilities to track objects across video frames or live feeds. Use the following example to enable tracking:

!!! example

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a pre-trained YOLO model
        model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")

        # Start tracking objects in a video
        # You can also use live video streams or webcam input
        model.track(source="path/to/video.mp4")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Perform object tracking on a video from the command line
        # You can specify different sources like webcam (0) or RTSP streams
        yolo track source=path/to/video.mp4
        ```
